		<div><h2 class="clr2">South Indian</h2><p>The smell of crisp vadas, the sound of spluttering mustard seeds, the taste of hot piping sambar made with fresh and pulpy tamarind, and the touch of feather-light, soft idlis - South Indain food appeals to all senses, is aromatic and delicious!Dosa and chutney are just a brief trailer to an otherwise long, colourful, rich and absolutely fascinating journey that is South India. With its 5 states, 2 union territories, rocky plateau, river valleys' and coastal plains, the south of India is extremely different from its Northern counterpart. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh each have their own culture, languages and by way of that many different cuisines.But before we get into details like ingredients and cooking techniques, let's talk about some aspects that are common to those that live in the South. Firstly, most people eat with their right hand and leave the left one clean for drinking water. Also, licking curry off your finger does taste really good! Rice is their grain of choice and lentil and daal are equally important. Sambhar, which is made with lentil, tamarind and buttermilk is also common to all South Indian states. But each has its own version.Pickles and pappadams are always served on the side and yogurt makes a frequent appearance as well. Coconut is one of the most important ingredients and is used in various forms: dry, desiccated or as is. Some of the cooking is also done in coconut oil. The South of India is known as 'the land of spices' and for all the right reasons. Cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, chilli, mustard, curry leaves - the list goes on.</p></div>

		<div><h2 class="clr3">Chinese</h2><p>That's amazing about Chinese food in India is that unless you go to a chain restaurant, you'll hardly find the same dish in two places. Don't get me wrong because all these places have the same sweet and sour prawns, mixed fried rice, chicken soup, and so on, but each place has its own touch in the dish. I think the whole versatility of the cuisine in this country is what makes it so popular.Chinese dishes are famous for color, aroma, taste, meaning and appearance.Veg momos, momos chutney recipe, fried momos, chilli mushroom, mushroom manchurian,mushroom fried rice, Chilli Parotta, Sweet corn chicken soup, Corn Manchurian Fried Rice, Spring rolls, chowmin, kurkes are some of the most common chineese food served. </p></div>
